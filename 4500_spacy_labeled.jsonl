For example: beef is traditionally served with a simple pan sauce or a horseradish cream sauce. Salmon and dill are a no brainer! ( try taking those traditional pairings and seasonings and using them in creative ways, like horseradish cream mashed potatoes with steak, or dill and bacon creamed corn with salmon) Pairing a meat with something that it often eats is also a great strategy. EX: chickens eat grains, seeds, and even berries, so a roasted chicken breast with a balsamic berry sauce and some wild rice or farro is guaranteed to be delicious!

{"text": "Only if you promise to let me know how you liked it :) Make sure you pop the ice cream attachment and the beater blade for it in the coldest part of your freezer for at least a day in advance for best results. Ingredients: * 1 Tbsp Cocoa Powder * 1 Cup Heavy Cream * 3 Cups Half and Half * 8 Egg Yolks * 9 Ounces Sugar * 2 Tsp Vanilla * 7 Ounces Milk Chocolate 1. In saucepan over medium heat, mix cocoa powder with 1 cup of half and half cream. Combine fully (no cocoa powder chunks!) and and the remaining half and half as well as the heavy cream. Bring to a simmer 2. Whisk the egg yolks until they are lighter in colour, then gradually add the sugar. 3. Slowly add 1/3 of the simmering cream mixture to the egg mixture, whisking constantly (this tempers the egg mixture). Once you've combined them thoroughly, pour this mix back into the saucepan on low heat. Whisk to combine. 4. Cook this mixture, stirring often, until it reaches 170\u00b0-175\u00b0 F. 5. Stir in vanilla and chocolate, then set aside until it reaches room temperature. (You should totally taste it now. This is a preview of the nirvana you will enjoy shortly.) 6. Refrigerate the mixture until it reaches 40\u00b0 F, then pop it in the kitchenaid ice cream maker and let it do it's thing. Make sure you turn the mixer on *before* you add the ice cream batter to it, or it won't churn as well. I like to shave some dark chocolate (or a white kit kat bar) and add it to the ice cream a minute or two before it comes out. When your kitchenaid starts clicking as it turns, your ice cream is pretty much done. Serve immediately if you ~~have no self control~~ like soft serve, or let it sit covered in the freezer for a few hours for a firmer texture. This ice cream is so silky smooth and rich - I hope you enjoy it! We also really like to add Bailey's, orange liqueur, chopped frozen berries, and toasted coconut flakes (not all together, of course - that would be madness!)

I just keep clorox wipes around and do a pass of wipe and another pass with a damp paper towel to get the residue off. Especially if meat gets somewhere. Is this probably the best alternative for home? That's one thing I've realized working fast food and the bit of restaurant chains, scaling makes some stuff so much easier. Like, I can't just go get my container of chopped onions, I have to sit there and chop one up, possibly dirty a dish to store it (if I need the cutting board) and repeat for pretty much everything. Dishes at home will almost always take a bit longer, kind of goes to your first point minimal ingredients can be great not only for flavor but ease of cooking. Of note with thermometers, try to get a thermocouple, not the run of the mill cheap thermometer. Thermocouples usually have a tiny taper at the end the size of a pencil led and only needs the very edge of the tip to read, so you don't have to lance your food to death to get a valid reading.

{"text": "Your anti-alton tirades make you come off looking really bad despite your obvious skill and experience. At best you come off looking jealous and petty and at worst you come off as hypocritical. Consider, you complain that most people don't know how to cook. Alton Brown has taught at least 10 people I know in person (myself included) how to cook by way of his television show. I have interacted with literally 100's more who have been inspired to pass on hot pockets or the olive garden to try and cook something themself. And despite what you say Alton espouses exactly what you claim to extol - being more self sufficient in the kitchen. While some things are obviously foolish or silly sniping at a successful TV chef that inspires thousands upon thousands who, unlike you, can use some judgement and overlook or ignore poor suggestions like drill powered pepper grinders doesn't make sense. Instead of being jealous and negative why not ignore him or find the positive in his successes? Here is one success that Alton Brown has achieved: He inspired me to learn to cook. As a result, both my daughters learned to cook and as a direct result I teach a one week girl scout class on ow to cook. I teach local college kids how to cook (also in a one week class). I also teach kids at summer camp how to cook (two weeks a year). So, yeah, no. Alton Brown is not fucking my wife. He is a successful and inspirational TV cook. You are not in competition with him nor is he you. But no matter how good you can prepare food I'd give AB's restaurant a shot way before I gave yours a chance. Why? Even if you were the better chef? Easy, both of you cook to earn money.

Secondly, this could be something you can together so she still feels like she is contributing- especially if she enjoys cooking. The absolute best part of these recipes is the intro. They talk about how the dish is traditionally made and common pitfalls. Then they walk through how they troubleshoot each issue- if a fix that makes it taste slightly better is too time consuming to justify it- they tell you!

{"text": "Hey, author of the post here. Here's a link to an article I wrote which has a bit more background info on the smashing technique. You're absolutely right - you want to smash at the beginning, but not once it starts cooking and the fat begins to liquefy. Smash once, leave it alone. As for the shrinking bit, that's why I use a stainless steel skillet with no oil in it. The meat binds to the metal (through actual covalent bonds!) when you press it down, so it keeps its size as it browns and sets. Then you scrape it up with a really stiff scraper or spatula. If you're talking about a more standard burger and not a smashed patty, then you'll want to make it slightly larger than the bun to start, and put a dimple in the center, which accounts for the fact that the edges cook (and therefore shrink) more than the center does. This compensates for the bulging that would happen if you cook a totally flat burger.

{"text": "There's something psychological at play here. Your ego is overriding your love for your partner. Not necessarily a bad thing, just a mechanical thing, which is extremely common and also easy to fix when you recognize it. Anyone who loves cooking is heavily invested in it as part of who they are. We live and breathe food. It's on our minds all the time. And the dark side of it is that when our loves and hobbies determine aspects of our personality we can also judge others. For example, if you have a strong opinion about someone who eats well done steaks with ketchup lol But in all honesty it's very trivial, right? A person's food preference. We are artists and culinary integrity is in our souls. Some people don't speak the language and it's not on them. So the complex act of cooking for your loved one, you need to split it apart. You don't need to inject culinary integrity into every act of cooking. The slight resentment you feel is actually that judgment that comes as the result of our obsession with food. Feeding your loved one should go in a different bucket, the fulfillment of doing something for them the way they like and making them happy. So if your partner just wants a kid's meal, make that kids meal, plate it nicely, get two small cups for ranch and bbq and just bask in the admiration of your partner gleefully and appreciatingly eating something you prepared, whether it's up to your standards or not.

{"text": "i may be a bit late to the party here, but i received a nutribullet about 2 months ago and i literally use it 3-4 times a day, every day. i consider myself a healthy person - i eat well and exercise, but sometimes eating healthy is just a hassle. the nutribullet definitely made the eating part way easier. i just buy the bulk 5lb spinach bag and bags of frozen fruit at costco and get some cheap kale and collard greens at my local asian mart. i splurged a bit on certain items like almonds, walnuts, seeds, macuna, spirilina etc. and put small amounts into my shakes. the reason why i drink it so often is it's just damn easy to make and to clean. i just throw all the stuff in there (2 minutes), blend it, drink it, and then rinse it. the nutribullet is gettin a bad rep here and it sounds like most criticizers haven't really used one for a period of time. while it could be that items like the vitamix last longer, the size and shape of the nutribullet really make it so easy to clean (i'm sure the magic bullet is the same way). and if your concern is durability, nutribullet provides a 1 year warranty. I think the vitamix is a good choice if you plan on doing more than just making juice. PS it's not a cheap motor. the base is relatively heavy and i must've used the product over 200+ already (other people in my household use it daily, too). the motor is still running and the blades are still \"extracting.\" as for its power, i put in almonds, chia seeds, flax seeds, frozen fruits etc. and it blends everything just fine. i've never had an issue with the nutribullet not blending the stuff i put in it. if you have any questions, pm me. fyi, i'm just a consumer.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 6.667943671345711e-05, "NOT_RELEVANT": 0.9999333620071411}, "accept": ["NOT_RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "6.667943671345711e-05"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "0.9999333620071411"}]}

A mainly veggie dish, but with a couple of rashers of bacon (We use english bacon) chopped up and cooked with it makes it 90% veggies, but very tasty and satisfying. There's something about roasted cauliflower with cumin that is very meatish. Very nice side. Most importantly, experiment. I know it's hard when you're cooking for just yourself, but it's the best time to experiment with different dishes because no-one will suffer except yourself. Enjoy experimenting.

{"text": "Burritos are really easy. You can buy the wrappers pretty cheap - when you get more adventurous, they're really easy to make by hand as well. The filling we like is: * 1 T cooking oil * half dozen fresh roma tomatoes, chopped * 3 to 6 serrano chilies, diced - or even more if like us you live on the east coast where the available fresh chilies are so mild you can barely taste them. * 1 to 2 tsp minced garlic (or 1 to 2 cloves of fresh garlic put through a garlic press). The minced garlic in the grocery store is generally super-mild, I get better, stronger garlic either at Costco or from an ethnic grocery (pre-minced stuff in jars). * large onion, chopped coarsely * Bell pepper, chopped coarsely * 1 can of black beans, DRAINED * 1 tsp ground cumin * 2 tsp chili powder * shredded cheddar, asiago, monteray jack, asadero, queso blanco - or just buy some pre-shredded Kraft Mexican Mix * sour cream * cilantro, chopped Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet. Dump in the onions and SERRANO peppers and garlic, and stir the spice in with them. Cook over med to med high heat, stirring pretty constantly, until the onions are starting to soften - the edges will start to look translucent, but the centers will still be white. Dump in the BELL pepper and stir fry a couple more minutes. Now add the tomatoes. Stir fry a couple of minutes. Dump in the (drained) beans. Stir well and let cook down so the moisture cooks off. Just stir once in awhile to keep it from sticking/burning. Meanwhile, take 2 burrito wrappers per person, wrap in foil, place on the top rack of the oven, and turn the oven on to about 400F. They will be heated through in 5 mins or so. If your oven is one of the dumb ovens that turns the top element on while preheating, place the wrappers on the BOTTOM rack. Too close to the broiler and they'll turn hard and won't wrap. They make fairly tasty dipping-chips though. When the tomatoes are done, turn off the burner, take a wrapper, slap a spoonful of the above filling in the center. Top with cheese, sour cream, and a sprinkle of cilantro. Fold the bottom edge a couple inches up over the filling. Put a dab of sour cream on the flap. Fold the left edge over and put a dab of sour cream along that flap. Fold the final edge over top of that. The sour cream will make the burrito wrapper stick closed. Chow down. I know, it's meatless. If you must have meat, you can add some shredded or finely sliced cooked beef or some cooked chicken at the end with the beans. Grilled or blackened chicken is pretty tasty in a burrito.

{"text": "I\u2019ve been to a couple Michelin Star restaurants. Manresa, which was very very good, very very expensive, and had a lot of pomp and circumstance. I liked the meal, but not enough to return. The other restaurant is a lot more interesting - Lazy Bear in SF. It started as an underground pop-up. I found out about them through an underground farmer\u2019s market (god I sound like a hipster but I live in the burbs and just want to try all the food) where they were serving this egg dish that was beyond delicious, started following them and then got tickets to one of their dinners. I would call it gourmet food with paper napkins. Casual (jeans and a shirt) environment, you kept one fork for the whole meal (they suggest just giving it a lick as prep for the next course), communal tables, and course after course of amazing food. After several years, several meals (including a brunch I still dream about) they went legit and opened a brick and mortar restaurant. Prices went waaaay up - I think it was about 65-80/person at the pop up and now I think it\u2019s hovering around 150-200/person. I have eaten at their legit restaurant twice and I have to say it\u2019s just as good as it was before, you just get more forks. Still pretty casual, but that\u2019s pretty typical for SF. I feel very fortunate to have been able to eat with them so many times both before and after they \u201cmade it\u201d. I would absolutely love to try The French Laundry one day, but besides more meals at Lazy Bear, I don\u2019t have any huge burning desires to seek out any more Michelin starred restaurants.

Normally this means all your washing up is all at once though, but use cutlery savers, we don't need to keep grabbing clean spoons to taste or stir.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 0.002700323471799493, "NOT_RELEVANT": 0.9972997307777405}, "accept": ["NOT_RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "0.002700323471799493"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "0.9972997307777405"}]}

{"text": "I'm not trying to pick apart your technique, but artisan pizza has been an obsession of my over the last few years and I think that I can offer some suggestions which may help even further improve your pizza, if you're interested. If nothing else, this may be a brain dump for anyone interested. Rising bread in the oven is a no-no; rising shouldn't happen in environments above 80F and it will likely dry out the outside of the dough at that temp. Slow ferment=flavor. Most people these days actually prefer a slow ferment in the fridge for ~12-24h. I like to then let it sit on the counter for ~3 hours after fridge ferment that before shaping, but some people say only 45m-1h is necessary. Also, you don't need pizza dough to double in size. Most bread bakers actually say it's not about volume increase, but the feel that lets you know when your bread is ready. If you're hand kneading you can knead for 45 minutes, but its pretty easy to overknead with a mixer. I prefer the romantic nature of working with my hands with the dough, so I really can't comment much on automatic kneading. I just took a bread class from some crazy French guy that makes amazing bread, though, and he says he recommends no more than ~10 minutes on the mixer. If you're working with wet dough, this French Fold technique is great (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvdtUR-XTG0) and the secret is to pull it off the counter real quick. Quick sharp movements. I've never had good luck with the broiler. I have a gas stove, though, so my broiler doesnt seem to get as hot. I can get a stone to ~660F without any oven tricks. I like to be at around 730-750 since I prefer a Neapolitan style. Sometimes I'll throw a frozen washcloth on the oven's thermometer to get into the temperature I like to bake at, though you need to remember to take that off when you're done (true story). Google 'Little Black Egg' (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtXTMufUMh0) if you are interested in an affordable outdoor pizza oven (this may be a summer project for me) capable of getting into Neapolitan temps. If I could boil down my beginner mistakes, they would be: * Measure ingredients out on a scale. Measuring flour by volume is too inaccurate. * Don't fear wet dough, and don't reach for flour when it is too wet. Trust the hydration ratio when you're starting out. Kneading will transform the gluten into something workable. The more flour you add, the more uniform your dough is going to become. 60% is a good place where it is manageable, yet still rewarding. * Preheat the stone for 1+ hour. Get that sucker hoooooot. Verify temp with an IR thermometer. The hotter you get it , the more open crumb (big flavorful holes) you get because you get better oven spring. * Use sauce and toppings minimally, or deal with your pizza sticking to your peel. * Work fast while preparing the pizza with toppings. I usually have it sauced, topped, and in the oven in about 60s from transferring the naked shaped dough onto the peel. Every 15s I'm shaking the peel to make sure nothing is sticking. Making pizza (Napels style, at least) may be one of the hardest things to do properly in the kitchen. It's quite an art form, and takes quite a bit of practice. The good pizza makers seem to make pizza almost once a week at home. Varsano's site helped me tremendously when I was getting started: http://varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm And I always pick up little things here and there from pizzamaking.com.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 2.129561717939543e-12, "NOT_RELEVANT": 1.0}, "accept": ["NOT_RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "2.129561717939543e-12"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "1.0"}]}

{"text": "If you want fairly easy cooking (and you have the available counter space), as well as cooking that translates well into leftovers/packed lunches, I would look into getting a slow cooker. Other than that the bare essentials are a skillet, pot, cutting board, and an oven pan (the stove does come with oven attached yes?). As well as the usual utensils (knives, measuring cups, etc).

So for (say) deep frying, or hot wok-frying stir fry, reach for the vegetable/canola/peanut oil; but your average sautee or roasted vegetables or whatnot, olive oil is fine. 2. Extra-virgin olive oil DOES have a low smoke point, and should mainly not be used in heat applications. 3. (This I had to realize myself) If you put something in the oven at 400, it doesn't mean everything within that oven gets to 400 degrees. The oil drizzled on top of your pizza, or cooking your roasted whatever, isn't that hot.

You basically start by making a roux, which is equal parts butter &amp; flour (you can use oil instead of butter, but the flavor will change). I normally do 4 T butter to 1/4 cup flour. Melt the butter, then add the flour, and cook until it's golden, maybe around 5 minutes (don't skip this step, otherwise the sauce will taste like flour). At this time you can add salt/pepper/dried spices. Once that's incorporated, add milk (I use 2 cups), then cook over medium heat till bubbly. At this point, you can add shredded cheddar or any other type of cheese. I use cheddar with a bit of freshly grated reggiano parmesan. I'd use about 2 cups cheese total for this recipe. Be sure to add the cheese off of the heat; it will melt right in. Add to cooked macaroni, and you're good to go.

Brown the meat, remove, caramelize the onions, add the carrots, lentils, stock, simmer for 15 minutes, add back the meat, and simmer for 15-20 minutes longer (add some water throughout the process if needed).

{"text": "The main problem is that customers don't realize that by sacrificing their local stores to save a few cents, they are shifting their locally-earned income to a company that doesn't put the same amount of money back into the local economy. In fact, they go to the trouble of putting as little as possible back in by producing all of the products they sell in the countries that can do it for the least amount of money and paying their employees the bare minimum. Yes, it's a hassle to have to drive to a store that sells vegetables and then go to a store that sells screwdrivers, and it may cost less, but the people who check you out aren't taking the vast majority of the money you spent on either item and spending it at a store that *you* own, continuing the cycle of the local economy. It goes to the Walmart company, which will almost definitely not be buying whatever products are made in *your* town. So yes, it might be cheaper when you're on a tiny budget (I am right now), but sooner or later, your town won't be able to sell anything because either Walmart will sell it cheaper, or you won't be making enough money to buy it because no one is buying anything at *your* place of business. Walmart is the \"kingpin it is today\" because people don't have enough foresight to buy local, and then they complain that there aren't enough jobs, but it's because they're supporting companies that don't give a shit about anything but their quarterly statement, and will exploit anyone's instinct to buy the cheapest product even though it's not a sustainable business model. They'll be laughing their way to the bank, and by the time people realize that they can't even afford Walmart prices any more, Walmart will be able to pack up and go home. People are ignorant, and they're going to pay the price, but until they see the bill, it's not an issue for them.

Recipe: For the chicken with spice butter: 50g room temp butter 1 tsp paprika Zest of 1 lemon 1 tsp dried oregano 2 garlic cloves, minced Salt and pepper 1 whole chicken, about 1.5kg For the veggies: 2 red peppers in chunks 2 onions in 1/8ths 1 punnet cherry tomatoes 3 carrots, in batons 3 tsp fennel seeds 1 whole head of garlic, topped 1 tbsp balsamic or sherry vinegar 250ml/1 cup white wine Salt and pepper For roast potatoes: 6 medium maris piper potatoes in chunks Sage Instructions: This recipe requires a slow cooker with an oven safe pot. Preheat the oven to 220C. Prepare the spice butter by mixing butter, paprika, oregano, zest, garlic to make a paste and spread all over the chicken, including putting some under the breast skin if you like. Brown in the oven for about 15 minutes breast side up. While the chicken is in the oven, prepare all the vegetables to go straight into the slow cooker (excluding the potatoes, which go into a pan of cold water, bring to boil and parboil for about 7 minutes). When the chicken comes out the oven, transfer to the slow cooker, breast down (reserve the fat in the pan for potatoes). Add the wine, vinegar and fennel seeds. Set the slow cooker to high for one hour, after which switch it to low for 3 hours. When the potatoes are parboiled, drain the pan, add sage and then with the lid on give the pan a good rattle to fluff the potatoes up a bit and set aside. Once the 4 hours of slow cooking are up, preheat the oven to 190C.

{"text": "Not at all a stupid question. Actually, it's a really interesting one that I could go on about at length. [After writing my comment, I look back and see that I do go on at length...] Essentially, it depends on what you want out of a pizza, or rather, what your idea of pizza is. It also depends on what your idea of tomato sauce is. As an American who grew up in Philadelphia in an Italian-American family, we ate a lot of \"gravy\" when I was younger. I don't know the secrets that went into the gravy that my grandmother and great aunts made, but I do know how my dad made it - lots of sausage, meatballs, and some other meat simmered for a long time in tomato sauce that is flavored with garlic and onion. Often there would be dried basil incorporated into this as well. This is what I think of as the quintessential version of \"spaghetti sauce\" in America - tomato, garlic/onion, meat, and long simmering. This sauce is meaningful to me, and it is delicious, but the way I think of Italian sauces these days is quite different. That Italian-American sauce came about via my Italian immigrant ancestors memories of their own Italian ancestors. It is an American memory of the old world that has become enshrined in the minds of many Americans as \"tomato sauce.\" So many people think of a tomato sauce as something that needs long simmering, always contains onion/garlic, and very often contains meat. If you look at Italian tomato sauces, however, this is not the case. There are many many tomato sauces for pasta in Italy. The one that is closest to the Italian-American version is probably Ragu Neapolitano, which contains beef and/or pork, onions, garlic, and long simmered tomatoes. But other sauces, like Marinara do not contain meat or onions and are cooked rapidly, creating a fresh tasting, bright red sauce with most of the natural acidity of the tomatoes intact. Marinara, as the name applies, is a sauce made by and for mariners and is great in a meal to complement oily fish like bluefish - you need that acidity to balance out the richness of the fish, and the brightness of the sauce is there to match a sunny, clear day by the water. It's a summery sauce that is light and is used for those occasions, whereas something like Ragu Neapolitano or Italian-American gravy is a heavier sauce that is better for cooler days or when you want to incorporate a big plate of meat into your table. So tomato sauces vary quite a bit and are made to suit the occasion, whether you want a lighter, brighter sauce or a richer, meatier sauce and everything in between. Now onto the pizza. I prefer thin crust, a bright tomato sauce, a relatively small amount of fresh mozz, and I go light on the toppings. I often top the pizza with a few olives or pickled peppadew peppers, and hit it with aged cheese and a few handfuls of arugula when it comes out of the oven. I might add some slices of soppressata when comes out of the oven as well. The toppings are just supporting characters; the essence of the pizza is a balance between crispy, chewy crust, bright tomato sauce, and a little richness form the cheese. If the sauce is too heavy and concentrated by being cooked down and having things like anchovy/Maggi/Worcestershire sauce or the sweetness of onions added to it, the sauce will be too rich to fulfill its function and the pizza will be out of balance for me. Now I say \"for me\" here purposefully, because a balanced pizza to me is a basic expression of bread, relatively unadorned tomato, and fresh cheese. It's straightforward and there's a clarity to it. That is not be everyone's vision of what pizza is, and typical American style pizza isn't about clarity and balance. The kind of pizza you will get 3/4 of the time if you randomly call a pizza place in most parts of the US will be balanced towards richness. It's frontloaded with sweetness from onions, concentrated by long cooking, and complicated with the addition of oregano and other seasonings. It resembles, to me, Italian-American tomato gravy in spirit - heavy and rich with an impression of abundance. This rich sauce is then combined with a fluffier dough that is often enriched with olive oil, milk, and even sugar sometimes whereas in contrast my dough is just a simple mixture of 500g flour, 375ml water, 14g salt, and a teaspoon of yeast. On top of that enriched dough there is a rich sauce, and on top of that rich sauce, there is rich, low moisture mozzarella cheese. And that is just before even more richness is added from toppings. I could go on, but I hope my point is made that there are two broad directions you can take with pizza - one with more balance between the elements that favors lightness, and one that is balanced toward richness. If you're going for the light version, which I prefer, then you don't want to overcook the sauce so as to retain the acidity of your tomatoes. If you're going for the richer version, you want to cook the sauce down so that you extract the maximum sweetness out of the onions, reduce the acidity of the sauce, and concentrate and thicken your tomatoes. It's all just a matter of style and preference. All pizza can be good pizza; the key is knowing what you're going for and executing. For many, cooked tomato sauce is the sauce of their memories and it's what they prefer. Whenever I'm cooking, I'm playing along with these memories - sometimes I play with them, sometimes against but they're always there and they shape how I think about what I'm making since what I'm making is an expression of my history, philosophy, and leads me into an unknown future - who knows what kind of pizza I'll be making in ten years? It will surely be different than what I do now. I'll be interested to see where it goes.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 3.428343492341973e-14, "NOT_RELEVANT": 1.0}, "accept": ["NOT_RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "3.428343492341973e-14"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "1.0"}]}

Stick it in the oven face up (broiler!) until it starts to get slightly golden/crispy. A good bun makes all the difference. An old stale bun can make even the best burger meat suck balls.

Warm an unseasoned pan (either new or stripped of seasoning*) for 15 minutes in a 200-degree oven to open its pores. 2. Remove the pan from the oven. Place 1 tablespoon flaxseed oil in the pan and, using tongs, rub the oil into the surface with paper towels. With fresh paper towels, thoroughly wipe out the pan to remove excess oil. 3. Place the oiled pan upside down in a cold oven, then set the oven to its maximum baking temperature. Once the oven reaches its maximum temperature, heat the pan for one hour. Turn off the oven; cool the pan in the oven for at least two hours. 4. Repeat the process five more times, or until the pan develops a dark, semi-matte surface. *To strip a cast-iron pan of seasoning, spray it with oven cleaner, wait 30 minutes, wash with soapy water, and thoroughly wipe with paper towels.

{"text": "####Whole fish - Steamed in a banana leaf (or tinfoil) As promised to lacewingfly: *This is my favourite method of cooking a whole fish. I generally use snapper, but any white fish will work, it just needs to be a *reasonably* flat fish. The banana leaf can of course be substituted for tinfoil, but the flavour released from the leaf makes it worth it. The seasonings I am using here are for a ginger and garlic taste, but really you could use any asian seasonings (I've done this with thai green curry paste very successfully).* *This recipe is best cooked on a bbq (grill), but absolutely still delicious if cooked in the oven, so don't worry if you can only do indoor cooking, it'll still rock.* *As usual, all of my quantities are approximate. I eyeball ingredients and add more or less of certain things to my own personal taste, so they are a rough estimate. It seems like there are a lot of steps below, but they're all easy I promise.* OK here we go: ***What You'll need:*** * Whole snapper or similar, scaled, gutted, cleaned, spines removed. Your fishmonger will do this for you if you ask them nicely (if you do this yourself be very careful with the spines on a snapper, they are SHARP AS FUCK!) * Stalk of lemongrass * Spring onions (some for cooking, some for garnish) * Fresh garlic * Fresh ginger (I often advocate jars of minced garlic and ginger, but here fresher is better) * Light soy sauce * Kecap Manis (sweet soy sauce, should be easily available) * Mild Long green chilli (we don't want this to be too hot as it will over power the fish) * Juice of 1 lime * Some thai fish sauce * Some finely ground black pepper * A banana leaf (or two small ones, or a pandan leaf, or tinfoil if all else fails) ***What you need to do:*** 1. Start heating up your grill, bbq, or oven 1. Take your banana leaves and soak them in warm water to soften them up a bit and make them a bit more pliable. 1. Peel a thumb sized piece of ginger and slice as thin as humanly possible 1. Peel three cloves of garlic and do the same 1. Take the lemongrass stalk, peel off the outer leaves slice the white part of the stalk, again as thin as you possibly can, do the same with the chilli (use as much or as little as you prefer) 1. Chop two of your spring onions and slice them on the diagonal (these don't need to be too finely sliced) 1. Put all of this in a pestle and mortar and give it a bit of a bash! We aren't trying to make a paste here but a bit of a bruising to release the flavours of the woody ingredients like lemongrass and ginger. 1. Combine (approx) 1tbsp Kecap Manis, 1tbsp light soy sauce, 1/4 tsp fine ground pepper, 1tsp fish sauce, juice of half the lime. Now check the balance! Is it too salty? Add some more lime juice. Is it too sour? Add some more Kecap manis. lacking salt? Add some fish sauce. Balance it out and get it right, trust your palate. (as an aside I tend to keep this one a *little* on the salty side, but that's just my taste.) 1. Once you're happy with the balance of the seasoning sauce, add your ingredients that you have sitting in the pestle and mortar. 1. Give it a mix. Doesn't it smell awesome? It smells like holidays! 1. Grab your fish, and a sharp knife. Slash the fish right down to bone in a few places, both sides of the fish. 1. Put it on a plate and get that delicious sauce all over it! In the slashes you made, in the cavity, on the skin, everywhere! Reserve a little bit of the solids from the sauce. 1. I'm going to have to be a little vague with wrapping instruction I'm afaid, as it depends on the size and shape of your leaves and your fish. Take your Banana leaf and lay it out flat. You are going to want a double layer of banana leaf if you are going to cook over fire or direct heat. Place the fish onto it and pour the remaining sauce over it. 1. Now you need to wrap it. Do it whatever way you can. Use soaked bamboo skewers or soaked twine to secure it all tight (I personally find skewers the best method, thread them through like you are sewing) 1. Lower the heat on your grill, you don't want to burn the leaf badly. It can stand up to some heat but not a high grill. 1. Place the package on the heat and leave it alone. If your bbq has hood, close it. 1. Cooking time depends on the size of the fish. Use your judgement. For a fish big enough to feed two people I reckon it takes about 15 mins over a medium low heat. I'll have to leave this step up to you. 1. While the fish is cooking take two spring onions and slice them paper thin on the diagonal, or cut into matchsticks, these are your garnish (or you could use some coriander leaves if you like it) 1. Presentation time: use a scissors to cut the parcel open *at the table*. OMFG when your guests get that smell bursting out when you open the parcel they are likely to foodgasm. Sprinkle in the chopped spring onions. I usually serve this just with small bowls of good basmati rice sitting on plates, and some stir fried asian greens (bok choi, kai lan, choi sum, whatever) and let people help themselves to fish. I prefer this method of serving, it's a bit more social. 1. Drink lots of ice cold beer. 1. Eat lemon or mango sorbet for dessert. 1. Have fun! I'm always open to comments and constructive criticism, so feel free to tell me what you think. I think this could be greatly improved if served with coconut rice.

{"text": "Just as an introduction to people who think they don't like tofu you should try Mapo Tofu...It's not exactly what you are asking for, but it fits in the same vein. It's one of my favorite dishes to make, and it's not only delicious but cheap and fast and a great gateway into what tofu can be. And yes there is meat... in it (there are also vegetarian/vegan adaptations but the dish isn't the same). But it's not really a meat dish, and it gives you that satisfying feeling you get from eating a bunch of meat, while only eating a little. I usually do 2 ounces of ground meat (pork is best, you want the fat) to 1 package of firm or extra firm silken tofu (silken is important!) . I've had the butcher ask why i want so little meat and even actually got him to try it himself. I eat way too much meat, most of us do. I wish I could eat less but it's satisfying, easy to cook, readily available (and never not ripe!), and really too cheap. (An aside, I sent my girlfriend to pick up some mushroom from safeway, and she got a package of 8 ounces, for 4 dollars, that's 8 dollars a pound for some fucking cremini mushrooms, there are so many meat options I can buy cheaper) But there are ways we can reduce our intake, and do better things for the planet, our taste buds, or even the animals (buying less of more expensive free range local meat from animals that had better lives than factory farmed meat). My real issue is just how hard it is to reduce my meat consumption at breakfast and lunch (I eat one or the other, along with dinner, so I usually am looking for something filling and satisfying). I can scramble up two eggs, throw a piece of ham with a slice of cheese in the toaster oven, throw two slices of bread in the toaster and have a really satisfying breakfast sandwich in around the same time it takes me to make a cup of coffee. I'm not into oatmeal or hot cereal (childhood trauma ;p), I do like granola, yogurt and fruit, but only if I can actually find ripe fruit. And it still isn't quite as satisfying. Anywhere I buy breakfast I can't remember the last time the vegetarian option appealed to me more than any of the normal ones. With lunch again, I can make a sandwich quickly, or buy one. I've tried some mozzerella tomato and basil sandwiches, but they are never good because the ingredients aren't fresh when you buy one, and you can't make one in the morning and not have it be soggy by lunchtime. When I go grab some tacos, kebab or a bahn mi again the veg options always seem more of an afterthought than anything. Or there just isn't the value on the menu, one deli where I used to live had a good eggplant sandwich, that cost just as much as a proscuitto brie and fig sandwich. Nothing against eggplant, but im taking the proscuitto brie and figs. As to straight up vegetarian, I'll do a coconut milk veggie curry with tofu (my curry paste probably has dried shrimp in it, but i know there are vegetarian alternatives). This chipotle miso tofu is also pretty damned good: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/07/grilled-tofu-chipotle-miso-recipe.html These Chayote squash tacos are so good you dont even think about meat when you eat them with some beans rice and grilled corn: https://www.rickbayless.com/roast-chayote-make-tacos-declare-victory/ Roasted butternut squash, carrot, onion, and mushroom enchiladas: Yea, that shit sounds great even if you were looking to eat meat. So many restaurants have blah vegetarian options, but this is something (similar) to what I ordered at a place because it sounded better than their meat dishes: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/12/enchiladas-suizas-rick-bayless-recipe.html I usually don't like vegetarian pastas, or well, I don't like vegetarian pastas with supermarket produce. It's never ripe enough, the flavors just don't pop. But if you've got a local market that has local food sources, or a farmers market there are a bunch of great pasta dishes you can make. The first is just a simple fresh tomato sauce with basil and olive oil. Best with fresh pasta, actually ripe tomatoes (two things money can't buy, love and actual vine ripened tomatoes) and good olive oil. :https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/anthony-bourdain/articles/spaghetti-with-fresh-tomato-sauce-and-basil but you can go all sorts of directions, get some fresh broad/fava beans, or some garden peas (also can throw either in a risotto).

That's the basic distribution, and it's already far more expensive than ours. Because our company buys in the same quantity as those large multinationals, and we have our own manufacturing / processing facilities, our raw material cost is the same, and warehousing cost for the specialist range is near nil in the big picture. Other independent retailers are also probably the same. Individual shipping may eat up margins, but ultimately it ends up cheaper because the bigger retailers also pay licensing fees, agency fees for buying, and a few others - none of which apply to the small ones who sell online. You're right about the ethnic stores sometimes having questionable quality. In a city like New York the general quality should be ok for whole spices, because you have a large community of people who will consume them, so whoever the importer is has more buying power. The only real issue I notice with them is hygiene, so you'll just have to do some manual selection yourself!

{"text": "You're going to want to do some Googling. Look up the Picayune Creole Cookbook, a good reference for Louisiana cooking. It's pretty old, so I believe it's available free online. Anyway, there are two broad styles of gumbo: Cajun and Creole. Both usually start with the trinity: onions, green peppers, celery. Many recipes start with a roux (equal parts flour and oil) cooked to some shade of brown, and then you add your trinity of aromatic vegetables, let it cook a bit, and then add some garlic. For a Cajun gumbo, you usually want the roux to go pretty dark, like chocolate. You also want the onions nicely caramelized. Some people do this in a separate pan; some just add them to the main pan, but before the rest of the aromatic vegetables. For a Creole gumbo, you don't brown things as much, and you usually add some tomatoes. Now, for the seasonings, you can add some store-bought Cajun or Creole seasoning, or you can just add stuff to taste if you have a well-stocked pantry. I like cayenne, paprika (preferably smoked), black pepper, oregano, thyme, bay, Worcestershire sauce. Then add some chicken stock and let it simmer, and add whatever meats you want. If you are using multiple meats, add them at the right time so they all get done cooking simultaneously. You can also brown meats in advance for additional depth of flavor. Some people say a gumbo must contain okra. If you want it, throw it in to simmer along with the meat. If not, you might want to add some fil\u00e9 powder. Do this right before serving, preferably on the plate; heating fil\u00e9 makes it stringy.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 0.9980366826057434, "NOT_RELEVANT": 0.0019633183255791664}, "accept": ["RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "0.9980366826057434"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "0.0019633183255791664"}]}

{"text": "You have just discovered a really tasty part of poultry that many overlook or get turned off to. I love these things. First, always give them a real good wash/rinse. Secondly, due to the large amount of connective tissue in gizzards, I find they either need to be cooked at higher heats (roasting, grilled) or cooked longer and slower. Hearts not as much, but they can be very chewy if cooked poorly. Both are very flavorful, almost the essence of whatever poultry they belong to (chicken/turkey, etc) Here's how I cook and eat both: Try tossing in salt/pepper/garlic and baking in a ramekin or on a sheet. I prefer the ramekin option. Boiled (for 20 minutes) and chopped or shredded fine they make a really nice addition to the appropriate poultry gravy, or even in a nice mashed potato. Save the water you boil them in for stuffing moistener or for stock or soup later. Summertime, I like gizzards and hearts on a skewer, marinated in anything that strikes your fancy, I tend to like garlicky or peppery marinades for 24 hours. Eat them right off a stick.

Light grill and regulate temperature to 250 degrees. Add cherry and pecan wood for smoking. Once the smoke turns from white to light blue and is not billowing white, it is ready for the chili. 2. In the meantime, chop celery and onion until you have 3 cups of each. Finely chop the jalapeno and the poblano peppers. 3. Using an enameled dutch oven, saute in 1 tbsp vegetable oil until translucent. Mince 4 cloves of garlic and add to the mixture Saute this mixture for about a minute, then make a hole in the middle of the vegetables for the spices. This will give them some space to bloom. After spices have cooked in the oil for a few minutes, mix everything together and let cook for another minute. Add 1 cup of red wine and let this simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce. Then add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, beef stock, beer, bloody mary mix, and pinto beans (optional). You can test for salt after this simmers for a few minutes. Bring this mixture to a slight boil, then let simmer. 4. Put the pot of chili on the grill indirect with an air gap under it. I rolled up 3 pieces of foil and set them under the pot so there was an air gap and it did not sit directly on the plate setter/heat deflector. This will prevent it from getting too hot and boiling over and the chili should have a slight simmer for the duration of the cook. 5. Prepare the ground beef by hand by rolling into an oval and dusting with salt and pepper. Place a rack over the chili, then the meat on top of the rack so it drips into the chili as it smokes. When the meat reaches 165 degrees internal temperature, the meat is ready to be broken up and added to the pot. Simmer for 20 more minutes and then serve hot with corn chips, cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onion.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 0.9259319305419922, "NOT_RELEVANT": 0.07406812906265259}, "accept": ["RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "0.9259319305419922"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "0.07406812906265259"}]}

Move the wok around to distibute the oil. Throw in a small amount of the meat slightly bigger than the flat part of the wok at most coated with s&amp;p no marinades.

Use damp paper towles to absorb any moisture and cook the meat/chicken in batches. Next cook the vegies. Add more oil, add garlic, cook for a few minutes, then add chillis, wit a few more minutes then add whatever other vegtables you want, stirfry until done. If you are using a lot of vegies you may want to look into just cooking the garlic and chilis in the wok and steaming or blanching the other veggies. Or just cook them in small batches in the wok. Absorb the moisture with a towel, add the chicken until everything is hot. Then serve with sauce on the side. You could put the stirfry on a serving platter or even in a large tupperware container for easy cleanup and then add the sauce to the stirfry.

{"text": "Cook to temp, not to time. Follow the advice of the other commenter and buy an instant-read probe thermometer; we're talking six bucks. You just need to bring the meat up to 165\u00b0. I've always had great results with the Cook's Illustrated method of flipping the bird three times during cooking. Start it on its side, wing-side up, and after 20mins flip it to its other side, wing-side up. After another 20mins flip it onto its back, so it's breast-side up. I always baste it after each rotation. This sounds like a lot of work, but if you're chilling in the kitchen while you cook it really isn't. **edit:** use either a roasting rack, balls of aluminum foil, or side items like onions and potatoes to hold it in place. Onions and potatoes will roast with the pan drippings and be delicious. Another tip is to pre-moisten the breasts by loosening the skin and putting butter and lemon under it. Literally just stick your fingers under the raw skin and loosen it away from the meat; you'll have to tear a slight membrane and if it's your first time it might feel a little uncontrolled. That's ok. The skin isn't going to float off if you loosen it \"wrong\"; there isn't a wrong way to do it. Slice a stick of butter into, like, 1/8tbsp pieces (your stick of butter has a printed measuring stick on the wrapper, just cut the smallest increment, which is a tablespoon, in half) and slip them under the skin. Bonus points for slicing 1/2 of a fresh lemon into thin wheels and slipping them in with the butter; stick the rest of the un-sliced lemon up the chicken's cavity before you throw it in the oven. The breast is the first part of the chicken to dry out because it has the least fat, so you want to add liquid to it during cooking however you can. Cooking it with butter and/or citrus under the skin (limes and oranges work just as well) and basting it will do this. Alternatively, if you don't really care about the skin, boil it. Stick that sucker into cold water and bring it to boil in a stockpot. In about 25 minutes it'll be *done.* The skin will be useless mush so discard it, but the meat will be tender and perfect for use in just about any recipe.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 0.00026947271544486284, "NOT_RELEVANT": 0.9997305274009705}, "accept": ["NOT_RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "0.00026947271544486284"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "0.9997305274009705"}]}

{"text": "Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do 180 new recipes, but take it from this old home cook, I've spent my entire adult life in the kitchen, and a program like this one can do more harm than good. If you only train one part of your palate (and that's all a single exercise like cooking is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for cholesterol down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine. Cooking basically only trains the stomach and to some extent, the small intestine. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major gastro groups (large intestine, liver, tastebuds) at the same time, over the course of a meal. And don't forget your dessert work! I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with food, eating a lot, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. But do it right, okay? My advice, find a good restaurant, with qualified chefs who will design your meal for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for yummy tendies. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). And don't worry about being embarrassed or being in shape the first time you walk into the restaurant. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.

No. Does the pleasure I get from making the starter, waiting a day, incorporating the eggs and butter, watching it rise, and seeing it come out of the oven more than make up for the lack of overall quality?

{"text": "Okay, I realize Installment one was Insomiac baking, but who cares, everything I do in the kitchen involving food prep and cooking/baking is when I can't sleep. This is a fun one to share because it gets rid of leftovers and you can take one day whenever you run low and make a shit ton of these babies. 1. Get tortillas, I like to get multiple sizes, so, depending on how hungry the body attached to the hand grabbing it, it will be satisfied. 2. Get all your shit ready. I usually do this when we have a lot of leftovers that would freeze well, for instance, in this case, eggs, shredded cheese, corn, onions, frozen hashbrowns, pork al pastor, and rice with beans. And then I get crazy and buy a few more things shredded chicken for the enchilda sauce we bought on sale forever ago, roll of sausage on sale, some cheap ass bacon, refried beans. 3. I line up all the different goodies and mix and match, some get eggs and cheese, some beans and rice and eggs and bacon, whatever combinations I feel like until I run out of tortillas or ingredients. IMPORTANT: it is important to put something that will keep the burritos from drying out when cooking i.e. refriend beans, cheese (I put this on all of them for insurance), the chicken soaked in enchilada sauce. No one likes a dry buritto 4. Wrap all the little burritos and the big ass ones too in saran wrap, let cool a little if your ingredients went in hot (mine were not) and then stick em in the freezer. 5. You're hungry; burrito! Depending on the size; wrap in paper towel and micro anywhere from 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Great! Husband fed.

Let me explain: Per Person: *3 eggs * 3 small corn tortillas * half an avocado * a bit o' cilantro * Refried Beans (optional) * A bunch of chunky salsa Method: Take a large skillet or sauce pot and fill with enough salsa to cover the bottom. Turn on medium-high heat until the salsa is bubbling. Then use a ladle or wooden spoon to create 3-4 divots in the salsa chunks. In the meantime, cut up your avocado into slices and chop some cilantro. If you want refried beans, get them heating up too. CAREFULLY crack and pour an egg into each divot. Cover the pot with a lid and let them poach for 5-6 minutes or so. Watch them, you'll know when it's time to go when the white of the egg has just fully covered the yolk. If you want them less runny, since I know you don't like eggs, just let them go a minute or two longer. When ready, scoop refried beans onto each corn tortilla and place an egg on top. Top with some of the poaching salsa, avocado, and cilantro and enjoy! These get messy, so bring a napkin.

Its also nice to use on pizza, gets the cheese nice and melty. Or you can get something cheaper like this torch, its smaller too. http://www.amazon.com/Iwatani-Cooking-Torch-Professional-Culinary/dp/B00BBJC1CY but you dont NEED a torch.

{"text": "*1. Android app** http://www.pepperplate.com is amazing. It's free, the desktop version syncs with mobiles and tablets, and you can scale recipes up and down. It's also super easy to add recipes you find: on some sites they even import automatically at a single button click. Otherwise you cut and paste and it formats everything for you. **2. Out of date vegetables** Some vegetables last ages in the fridge, eg carrots. Salad greens don't do so well. Even if carrots get a bit withered they're still great for stews (after all, our ancestors stored vegetables all winters). I personally find frozen veg has an odd taste, but frozen sweetcorn is great. **3. Quick meals** Here are three super quick and easy meals that you can make from long-lasting pantry ingredients, including frozen chicken pieces: * Italian Pasta &amp; Bean Stew - lasts a week in the fridge. Ignore the bean-soaking stuff, I just use canned. Base recipe is a little bland, I would add paprika and chorizo (but some kids prefer bland so it's useful if that's the case). You can skip the spinach if you don't have any to hand, and you could get away without the celery if you needed as well (so just beans, onions, pasta, bacon). * Crockpot Peanut Chicken - the only slow cooker recipe I have found that has the perfect, thick sauce after cooking. Serve with anything you like, even just bread, and you can skip the fresh herbs. * Smokey beans - I'm not even going to link to a recipe as this one is so easy. Chop and soften-fry an onion. Add a can of tomatoes and a can of beans (any kind: chickpeas even, if you like. Cannellini are great). Add a couple of tablespoons of BBQ sauce. That's it. You can add whatever else you like to it: chopped up capsicum peppers, carrot, sweetcorn, chopped herbs, chopped sausage/chorizo, bacon. Whatever else you have spare. But the basic beans/onions/tomatos are fine, and great with crusty bread. **4. Storage** You can store nearly everything longer than it says. You can also freeze milk. Old/tired vegetables can be used for a stew, no one will notice (their nutritional value may be a bit degraded, but they won't be harmful). Store dried herbs and spices in the fridge if you can. If space is an issue, buy mixes. \"Moroccan spice\" blend instead of separate cumin, coriander, ginger, etc. \"Mixed herbs\" will go with everything from French to Italian, pasta, pizza, stews. Soy sauce is a great way to add a bit of flavour to things and lasts for ages.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 2.686382231331663e-06, "NOT_RELEVANT": 0.9999972581863403}, "accept": ["NOT_RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "2.686382231331663e-06"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "0.9999972581863403"}]}

Supermarket tomatoes tend to be picked and shipped green, then ripened via exposure to ethylene gas. They don't develop the flavors they would on the vine. If you do get fresh tomatoes, they take a very long cook time due to all the water. My mom grows her own and they are delicious, but she freezes hers before turning them into tomato sauce. It removes a very large percentage of the water without much effort or energy. You can even give them a squeeze at that point if you want them really dry for a dish. Regarding the blandness, you should add more umami ingredients. Mushrooms, worcestershire or other fish sauce, or even straight up MSG are good options.

The oven takes longer but offers a much greater margin of error with a darker roux. Once the roux is the right color, add your liquid until the viscocity feels right to you.

Deboned, I like the kind with skin on one side * Salt * Pepper * Olive oil * Lemon juice (optional) **Recipe:** 1) At least 2 hours before cooking, earlier if possible, submerge the plank in water and let it soak (weigh it down with something so it's completely covered) 2) If using a charcoal grill, start the coals. If using gas, you can turn it on later. 3) Cover flesh side of salmon with a thin layer of olive oil, then salt and pepper to taste. You can add lemon juice here if desired, but I don't think it needs it. 4) Take plank out of the water, place salmon on the plank 5) Once the grill is hot, place the salmon (with plank) on the grill and close it. I use indirect heat, putting the charcoal on one side, and food on the other. 6) Cook for 8-15 minutes (cooking times vary greatly depending on your grill), until the fish is 120-130 F for medium rare. If you don't have a thermometer, it should flake easily with a fork 7) Let rest for 5 minutes covered in foil.

{"text": "Hello fellow night shift worker. I know what you mean about being not being hungry for the first few hours after you wake up. From my experience its not really worth forcing yourself to eat if you're not hungry, but as far as your mood is concerned you're probably going to be a much happier person if you've eaten before you go to work. Porridge and toast can be bland, but they can also be exciting. For instance, try changing the bread you buy around, or more importantly, buying higher quality bread, as well as butter, and then buying a small selection of different jams. I enjoy Apricot Jam a little too much (I grew up on a stone fruit orchard), so I went and bought strawberry, orange and a mixed fruit jam to add to my collection. I stopped there because those jams will collectively last me a year. With porridge your best friend is fruit. I don't know how you serve your porridge currently but when I used to eat (I don't anymore) I added a small dollop of fresh cream and served it with diced fruit on top. Mint is also relatively neutral, so if you're a fan of mint adding a few leaves might also be worth a try (Spearemint would be my go to). Alternatively you could add muesli and yogurt to your diet, as well as cold meats, cheeses etc. Its starting to get cold here in Australia so what I've started to do is put the oven on, peel some potatoes, carrots, turnips, sweet potatoes etc and then just roast them in the oven. They take long enough that by the time they are ready I am hungry, and the beautiful aroma means I'm usually famished. Its also the kind of meal that requires enough effort for reward that it feels like its worth the while, and leaves you plenty of time to clean up while you wait.

{"text": "I do Marley Spoon (Australian version). Observations: **The good...** 1. It's wonderful to not have the mental hassle of choosing and planning, and the physical time of shopping, for every meal 2. It's a really great way to learn to cook and expand your cooking techniques and repertoire. (Much cheaper than cooking lessons, and easier and more structured than working your way through a cookbook). 3. You get far more variety for a lower price than you would do with supermarket shopping 4. It's more expensive than supermarket shopping: *unless* you're an impulse buyer/poor planner/lover of more gourmet foods. 5. In the latter case (more gourmet meals) I've had Marley Spoon meals before that cost less than buying at the supermarket. Eg one that came with four different fresh herbs: at a major Australian supermarket, these would be at least $10-12. 6. With Marley Spoon you get to choose each week's meals from a list of seven - OR you can just let them pre-select. This is great if there's a particular ingredient you don't like. With many recipe delivery services, you get what you're given, no choice. **The bad...** 1. Packaging waste. It's pretty awful. Supposedly the cardboard is recyclable, but every week comes with these silver cold bags with frozen gel/ice packs within. All this gets chucked out. (Sure you could re-use - but who needs more than one or two? You'll be getting half a dozen more each week). 2. Currently they make it very hard to switch between Couples and Family. You have to adjust your account settings, at a specific time each week so you don't reset your in-progress order. You can't mix it up either. It's a shame, because 2-person during the week, with one Family on weekends would be ideal.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 9.668505995819032e-10, "NOT_RELEVANT": 1.0}, "accept": ["NOT_RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "9.668505995819032e-10"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "1.0"}]}

{"text": "Don't thaw your salmon in water. Put it in on a plate, in plastic, in your fridge overnight (ca 8-10 hours). Then you season it, leave for five minutes at room temp and cook it. A few tips on cooking salmon well: * Searing it in a quality pan is the best and easiest way. This also gives you much more control of the heat than in an oven. * Fire your pan up to mid-high (7/10), add 1 tbs of olive oil and let it get nice and hot. Then you turn the pan down to medium (5/10) before you add the salmon. * Us your hands, utensils can break your filet. When adding in the pan, make sure the fish \"lands\" pointing away from you. This way you don't get splashed by really fucking hot oil. * Watch it as it cooks. You can see the color changing from the bottom to the top. When it's tanned about 40%, you flip it. Again, just use your hands. This should be the only time in the cooking process you touch the fish in the pan. * Your salmon is done when its cooked 40% through on each side. About 1/5th of the filet size should be pink in the middle. Images for reference: Perfect vs overcooked.

{"text": "I cook both ways. I have a health issue that screws up my sence of taste and smelling, some days. (headaches with auras and a pervision of smells. Ocassionally a fresh peach off the tree smells like rotten meat). My poor daughter has Zero sense of smell so her ability to taste is cockeyed too. So when we are sharing recipes we often use exact so things can always be duplicated. If I start adding spices from my imagination to a dish, I write it down exactly for Dear daughter. Thank good for a good cooking scale. My grand daughter is the offical taster and sniffer for our cooking marathons. I believe that recipes are a great place to start. If I offend someone with a too weird dish I just say Sorry and don't do that again. I totally believe that the sense of taste has a whole lot to do with genetics and your current life. Example. Science has proven that people that over use salt, often while they were in the womb, their mother had a lot of morning sickness/nausia. The mommy was often dehydrated from vomiting during the pregnancy. The developing baby is \"raised,\" so to speak in a high salt atmosphere. As a functioning human, they crave salty foods and often oversalt the foods they cook. Also our sense of taste has to do with the chemicals in our body. You have heard that certain meds will make your foods taste metalic or very blaw tasting. Each of us at the stove has to cook the way our family likes no matter what the recipe says. That is why there are about a million recipes for speggetti sauce, \"just like grandmas\". So one written recipe calls for a pinch of salt but the cook uses a tablespoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of sugar to get the flavor they want. Our medicines and the chemicals we put on our skin and use in our house, really make a difference in the way we taste/perceive a food.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 7.211666002149286e-07, "NOT_RELEVANT": 0.9999992847442627}, "accept": ["NOT_RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "7.211666002149286e-07"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "0.9999992847442627"}]}

{"text": "Potato soup. You can dress it up or down, but it's delicious and hearty. Maybe not great if you're in the hemisphere moving into summer, but a good standby for the winter blahs. I start by sauteing garlic and onions in olive oil (or butter, or the grease left over from cooking up homemade bacon bits...just saying...) in a large stock pot. while cooking, I dice up a bunch of Yukon gold potatoes (or russet or Idaho or whatever floats your boat). After the onions and garlic are nice and soft, I add the potatoes into the pot with enough chicken stock to cover all the potatoes. I add salt and pepper. How much will differ with what kind of stock you use. Less is more in this instance as you can adjust later. I also add celery seed and rosemary and whatever other spices jump out at me from the cabinet. I boil the crap out of the potatoes until they're soft. Remove from heat. Then I add a little milk (or cream, or more chicken stock or butter or a combo of all or try something like yogurt or sour cream). I take my stick blender and whirr the whole thing until its relatively smooth. I like it a little chunky. If you need more liquid, add it now. Taste. Does it need salt? Add salt. Do you love cheese? Stir in some shredded cheese while it's still smoking hot. Serve with green onions, bacon bits, shredded cheese.

{"text": "*Pan Temperature** Frying is normally done in oil that measures between 350 and 375\u00b0 using an infrared thermometer. There are several methods that can be used to determine the proper temperature without using a thermometer. *Brown Butter Method* Put butter in the pan and begin heating. As the pan heats up, the butter will melt. When the pan reaches a temperature of 212\u00b0, the butter will start to bubble as the water in the butter starts to evaporate. As the temperature rises, sputtering increases and then stops. The milk solids in the butter begin to brown rapidly when the temperature reaches 250\u00b0. This is hot enough for low temperature frying, sweating onions, or making omelets. *Shimmering Oil Method* Put canola oil in the pan and begin heating. As the pan heats up, the oil will flow smoothly and quickly around the bottom of the pan. When the pan reaches a temperature of 275\u00b0, the surface of the oil begins to glisten and shimmer. When the oil is shimmering all over the pan, the temperature is 325 to 350\u00b0. Continue heating and a few wisps of smoke emerge when the temperature is around 375\u00b0. By the time the temperature reaches 400\u00b0, multiple wisps will be easily visible rising from the pan. *Chopstick Method (Chinese Stir-fry Test)* Place the handle of a wooden spoon or chopstick into the oil. If the oil bubbles steadily, the oil is hot enough for frying. If the oil bubbles furiously, the oil is too hot and needs to cool off a little. If no or very few bubbles form, the oil is not hot enough. *Bread Cube Method (Joy Of Cooking)* Drop a half-inch cube of bread into the oil. If it takes 60 seconds to brown, the oil is at 365\u00b0. *Popcorn Method (Cooks Illustrated)* Drop a single kernel of popcorn into the oil as it is heating. The kernel will pop when the oil reaches between 350 and 360\u00b0 (Remove the kernel and start frying) *Leidenfrost Effect (Rouxbe Cooking School)* The Leidenfrost effect occurs when a dry pan heats up, at 374\u00b0 an eighth of a teaspoon of water will form immediately into a single ball that glides around on the surface of the pan. As the temperature increases the water test shows: * The water pools and evaporates slowly (tepid) * The water boils quickly and evaporates rapidly (warm) * The water boils vigorously and evaporates very rapidly (warmer) * The water steams rather than boils and evaporates immediately (not hot enough) * The water pool breaks into multiple small balls that dance around the surface of the pan (almost there) * The water forms immediately into a single ball that glides around on the surface of the pan (perfectly hot) * The water spurts immediately into multiple small balls that disperse quickly (too hot)", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 0.999841570854187, "NOT_RELEVANT": 0.00015839240222703665}, "accept": ["RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "0.999841570854187"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "0.00015839240222703665"}]}

{"text": "$430 a month on food is a nice budget for one person, including snacks and so forth - but you need to learn to work with leftovers. Either enjoying them as leftovers or learning to reuse them. Some of my standard meals during the course of a week include a whole roasted chicken (roasted chicken and veg the first night, then sandwiches for lunch, then maybe chicken tacos or chicken enchiladas the next night [with leftovers of that for the next lunch], then make stock from the carcass for using in other meals. I also do a lot of big pots of soup, stew, or chili that can be either eaten on for a couple of days or you can make double or triple batches of some things and then freeze them for later in the week or month (keeps me from getting tired of the same thing over and over). And I have to admit for a fondness for old-fashioned tuna noodle casserole (with homemade mushroom sauce) with frozen veggies in it. It also serves well for a couple of meals at a minimum and some leftovers you can freeze and nuke for later. Being willing to do a few veggie or low meat meals will help keep costs down as well. Make a pot of beans and rice or a veggie stir fry (or one with very little meat added). Breakfast for dinner can be cheap and really delicious, too. Speaking of breakfast, get away from cereal since it's expensive. I love steel cut oats in the winter - they're a little more expensive up front, but a 1/4 cup expands in a cup of water to make a nice serving, and when topped with cut up fruit, it's a good bit of food. Or mix oats with a little cheese and top with a fried or poached egg for a savory version. One thing I do that saves money is wait until chicken breasts go on sale for some ridiculously low price. Then I'll buy a bunch and poach them in water that has a big scoop of taco seasoning in it. Shred them and then freeze them in 2 serving packets. That chicken can be used in enchiladas, tacos, nachos, any type of Mexican dish you want, and it's pre-cooked and ready to go. Avoid prepackaged snacks and things that are in \"single serving\" sizes. They actually wind up costing more per serving. Obviously don't buy in bulk if you don't have a way to freeze/preserve things, but there's a balance between the two. I think on your budget you could have some great meals.

{"text": "Lived in Thailand for 8 years. here's some stuff. * the eggs are fine. Most of them seem to be pasteurized, if you don't get a fridge the trick to storing them longer than a week seems to be rotating them so they don't stick to the inside of the shell. You can test the freshness of eggs with a glass or bowl of water. an egg is good if it sits on the bottom of the water or one end of it still touches the bottom. An egg is bad when it floats. * buy fresh local greens and keep them in water. cilantro (pak chii), morning glory (pak boong/pak bung), spring onion (don hom) all work well this way. Also, Thai garlic (the purple-husked kind you may be seeing at the markets) is particularly good for storing in the open, I recommend just keeping it in a basket so the open air doesn't promote mold. Same deal for chili pepper and so on. * * Also explore the available dry ingredients. Dry shrimp, squid, cuttlefish, etc Gung haeng, blameuk haeng, etc. There are also a variety of pickles- pak dong, gratiam dong, king dong, etc. * the water machines are safe enough.

Alton Brown featured this method frequently, and stressed the all important \"wet hand\" and \"dry hand.\" This is traditionally Flour, egg wash (egg, milk), and your finishing coat (bread crumbs, flour, or cornmeal). This method will create a nice crunchy batter when fried. It is good for cheese, meats, poultry, vegetables. Second, the wet batter. This contains the famous Tempura style batter and Beer batter. Basically, mix flour with your wet ingredient. Dip what you want fried in the batter, and fry it. Usually, you will coat what your food in a starch of some kind before applying batter, but you do not always have to. Usually you see vegetables fried like this. Meat options I have seen are beer battered Cod and corn dogs Third is dusting or coating in the dry batter. This is used on seafood a lot. Fried oysters, calamari, shrimp. Also, anything \"lightly breaded\" is usually prepared this way. Basically, toss or coat your food in seasoned or plain flour, cornmeal, bread crumbs, etc. and cook. Often, the fried item in question will either be wet from its own juice already (like shucked oysters in a tub are) or will be in a bath or sorts (like soaking catfish filets in seasoned buttermilk).

{"text": "Calphalon's 10inch Tri-Ply stainless pan is always at Macy's. If you can get it on sale or with a coupon, it should be around 30 bucks. The pan is awesome if you're a stainless steel fan - even heat distribution, extremely efficient heat conduction (you will never have to cook on high heat with this thing if you pre-heat properly), thick all around (not just on the bottom), stainless steel handle (withstands the oven) that stays cool during stovetop use. The only issue with it is that the steel used tends to get black stuff baked into it - almost like a cast iron seasoning. It's really weird. However, it can be removed with Barkeeper's Friend (about $2 at any grocery store cleaning section or Home Depot) or just a bit of work with a steel wool. Or, you can just ignore it since it won't come off. I also tend to think that carbonized pans are a badge of honor, a sign of meals prepared, so it doesn't bother me at all. The only issue is that 10inch might be too small if you're cooking for a family. EDIT: after reading some replies on here, this will probably be one of the more expensive ways to go. I agree with perrycox - IKEA is pretty awesome. Aluminum - eh. AFAIK all hard-anodized (black) aluminum pans are nonstick, which is not what you're looking for. Bare aluminum is used by restaurants, and I've made cheese sauce in a bare aluminum pot before. The pros of it are that it's light, absurdly cheap, a top-notch conductor, and obviously tough enough for commercial duty. You treat it just like stainless steel. The cons are reports that it can interact with acidic food, although I wonder if the Aluminum Oxide coating (naturally forms in a microscopic, air-tight layer when truly bare aluminum is exposed to air) would protect the pan from acid. That would mean that you should avoid using metal utensils in an aluminum pan... but this is all guesswork. I've never used it at home. I would go ahead and not worry about the Alzheimer's thing simply because so many restaurants use them.

{"text": "Durability and weight mainly, a plastic board is much more susceptible to being knocked around simply due to being vastly lighter for one. Though that same lightness may be an actual benefit depending on how you see yourself using it. As for the durability a high quality wood cutting board if well maintained will last a *very* long time through a significant amount of abuse. Meanwhile plastic can only take so much before it needs to be replaced. Additionally wood has the benefit of looking significantly better (in my personal opinion anyway) and having the possible advantage of being turned into an entire counter/island for an absolutely massive work surface if you wanted to go that route. The main durability concerns are mostly going to be gouging into the board, especially if you are using something like a cleaver and swinging with force through bones you will quickly destroy a normal plastic board. Assuming you aren't going to be doing that it will still inevitability accumulate many little scratches that would be recovered in a wooden board during maintenance. If you intend on running it through the dishwasher its lifespan will dramatically decrease due to the likelihood of warping but I don't count that against it really since it isn't like you can through wooden boards through a dishwasher anyway. At the end of the day despite being a crazy elitist personally who loves his high quality wooden cutting board I'm pretty sure what you are looking for is a plastic one. Just make sure to get the biggest size the other person has room to put it since it really is a massive pain to work on a tiny little board. Plastic trades top end quality and lifespan for ease of maintenance and weight/thickness as well as being significantly cheaper and that sounds like where your priorities are at. Though for real make sure to tell them not to try and put it in the dishwasher, depending on the washer it really can ruin them really fast, plastic easily warps when heated and things get surprisingly hot in a modern dishwasher.", "cats": {"RELEVANT": 2.036696514551295e-06, "NOT_RELEVANT": 0.9999979734420776}, "accept": ["NOT_RELEVANT"], "answer": "accept", "options": [{"id": "RELEVANT", "text": "RELEVANT", "meta": "2.036696514551295e-06"}, {"id": "NOT_RELEVANT", "text": "NOT_RELEVANT", "meta": "0.9999979734420776"}]}

{"text": "It is by far inferior in taste, texture, and nutrition. It's also ridiculously more expensive. (The cheapest way to buy rice is in bulk from Asian groceries; either Jasmine or Basmati is tastier than the American stuff, and a 20-lb. bag will often cost you no more than $10 and last you a year or more. Just keep it dry and bug-free and you're good.) Here is how you make basic, plain long-grain white rice of any variety (including jasmine or basmati) on a stovetop. Read the entire instructions before you start or I will not guarantee success. It's actually ridiculously simple, but there are various factors it's important to take into account. The easy version: put 1 part rice, 2 parts water into a pot, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, cook 15 minutes, remove from heat and leave to stand, covered, for 10 more minutes. That's all. The clueless person version: 1. Get out a pot that has a lid and will hold 50-100% more than the volume of rice and water you're putting into it. Otherwise your pot will overflow when the water boils. I recommend nonstick pots for rice, and ONLY for rice, because if you burn rice any other pan will be a writeoff. 2. Measure out the rice. A typical serving is between 1/4 cup and 1/3 cup per person. You're measuring by volume so what type of container you use makes no difference. *If you don't like your rice sticky, rinse the rice thoroughly before cooking it. You will be removing most of the remaining nutrition in the process, but that's your choice. *If you are making basmati rice, you can rinse and then soak it in cold water for 20-30 minutes and then drain before cooking. The grains will lengthen but otherwise the cooking process is the same. *If you expect each grain of rice to come out perfectly separate, you are a philistine and you can ignore these instructions and cook your rice like pasta in a big pot of boiling water, you prissy pantywaist. 3. Put your rice, whether dry or drained, into the pot. Using *the same measuring container*, add exactly twice as much water. Again, you are measuring volume. Volume is all that matters. 4. Place the pot on a burner and turn it up as high as it will go. PAY ATTENTION. Small quantities will boil very quickly. Give it a stir or two to prevent it all from sticking to the bottom of the pan. 5. As soon as the rice comes to a full, rolling boil (and NOT BEFORE), put the lid on the pot and turn the heat down very low. How low depends on your stove. If it heats really well, go straight to minimum. If it's a wimpy stove, go to the 2nd lowest setting. If you're using a gas stove, you may need to use a heat diffuser for optimal results. 6. Set a timer for 15 minutes. If you're using an electric stove, you may need to watch the rice for another minute or two, just to make sure it doesn't return to boiling; if it does, lift the lid until it stops boiling and then replace it. Once you're sure it's not going to boil over, walk away. Resist the urge to fuss. DO NOT remove the lid again until I say so. 7. When the timer goes off, remove the pot from the heat. Leave the lid on. Allow to stand for 10 more minutes. Congratulations, your rice is done. You may now remove the lid.

You can also include spices in the brine, depending on the flavor profile you're going for. When it's finished brining, bake it in a pan filled with water (keeps it moister) and prepare a glaze. The glaze is probably where you'd wanna work the Bud Light in. A traditional glaze has is usually sweet and spiced, with brown sugar, mustard, cloves, etc...I imagine you could work beer into that.

All meat that is sold in USA has been inspected, but not necessarily graded. All this means the meat the OP is finding in his supermarket has an unknown quantity of fat marbling. It is however perfectly safe to eat. On this point, you can visually inspect the fat marbling in the meat to get a good cut of meat.

Scones are incredibly flexible. Once you have the base recipe down you can get pretty creative with the add-ins. Oatmeal cookies are equally flexible. Cakes, not so much. Generally speaking, you can easily mess around with the flavor of the baked good and be successful. Adding vanilla and almond extract to a white cake recipe, for example. Or if you're making a pumpkin loaf, you can tweak the spices, and/or brown the butter. Use grapefruit peel instead of lemon. Cut back on the sugar in a frosting recipe.

The person with Type 2 diabetes, unless s/he is a complete n00b and was just diagnosed yesterday, has a mental list of foods to avoid and foods to choose, and if presented with a normal menu of \"meat, starch, 2 veg\", can usually pick and choose the healthful options. Where the problems lie is in a menu that is carb-heavy, such as cracker canapes AND mashed potatoes AND stuffing AND baked yams AND baked beans AND dinner rolls AND your choice of cake or pie for dessert. The person sometimes feels obligated, because it's a holiday, to eat some of everything. Or sometimes they just like to eat it, and so they cheat, especially if they're new at the diabetes thing. So a lot depends on how well you know this person, and how familiar you are with their self-control. Are they the sort to be unable to say \"no\" to some of their dining options? If so, then it's not a kindness to load up the buffet with all kinds of stuff they shouldn't eat; stick to the turkey, its stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, a couple of cooked veg, a green salad, dinner rolls, and in addition to whatever dessert you want, include something sugar-free for a dessert, but not fruit, since fruit still counts as carbs, so isn't always the \"healthy\" option for diabetics.

It's so intense that it's really only useful if you think \"this should make me sweat\"; but for that, it is awesome and tastes good to boot. * Smoked chipotle powder -- this adds heat, but it also adds a great level of smokiness. * Cinnamon -- this can add an oft-overlooked depth and taste to richer dishes. * Nutritional yeast -- this isn't really a \"spice\", but it's also not a \"food\" or a condiment or whatever. I like it because it has a lot of benefits, particularly for vegans, and it adds a great cheesy and nutty taste. It's great sprinkled in or baked on medium-light foods. * Smoked paprika -- it adds smoky flavor and, while not spicy, can add a little bit of heat. Plus it has great flavor. Medium-light foods IMO. * Dill weed -- it makes something taste almost lighter, if that makes sense. It's great for lighter dishes.
